      <description>I am a student currently studying Economic Management, with a passion for cybersecurity and linux. This is my personal blog site, which I set up with a view to document my journey learning cybersecurity through articles on topics I learn. Besides the site will also hold some other tech stuff that I might be interested in and take up as a project.
This blog has been setup as a means of documenting my journey in the field and also to write posts on my findings and learnings, as I beleive, documenting what I do or learn is much helpful to me to have a clear understanding of the topic in scope, and also it might help others.</description>
